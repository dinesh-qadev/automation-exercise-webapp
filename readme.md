Welcome to my **Selenium Python Automation Framework**! This project is designed to showcase **real-world test
automation** concepts and practices. It's a learning reference for anyone looking to get started with Selenium, Python,
and Pytest for UI test automation.

A scalable and easy-to-maintain **Selenium automation framework** built using **Python**, **Pytest**, and the **Page
Object Model (POM)** design pattern. This project automates end-to-end test cases
on [AutomationExercise.com](https://www.automationexercise.com/), a demo site for practicing real-world web UI testing.
