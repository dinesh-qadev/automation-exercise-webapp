Welcome to my **Selenium Python Automation Framework**! This project is designed to showcase **real-world test
automation** concepts and practices. It's a learning reference for anyone looking to get started with Selenium, Python,
and Pytest for UI test automation.

A scalable and easy-to-maintain **Selenium automation framework** built using **Python**, **Pytest**, and the **Page
Object Model (POM)** design pattern. This project automates real-world e-commerce flows
on [AutomationExercise.com](https://automationexercise.com) and demonstrates CI/CD, Allure reports, and headless browser
execution.

## Test Cases Overview
This repository contains automated tests that validate various features of the automationexercise.com application.
Here you can find the detailed testcases: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUxqXTgNuichaF1jcYwfu4PFWOOiKpK-FEF60RkuZe4/edit?gid=0#gid=0 

---

## Test Plan Overview
### Test Strategy
This test automation framework focuses on end-to-end functional testing, ensuring the core features of the application
are validated:

- **Functional Testing:** Verifying that each functionality, such as login, search, and checkout, works as expected.
- **Regression Testing:** Ensuring that recent updates do not break existing functionality.

### Test Coverage
The test cases cover the following features:

- **User Authentication:** Login, Registration, Logout
- **Product Search:** Search functionality for products
- **Shopping Cart:** Add/remove products from the cart and proceed to checkout

## Setup Instructions

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/dinesh-qadev/automation-exercise-webapp.git`

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

If pycharm is an IDE, It automatically suggests creating a virtual environment when you create a new project. Here is
how to Set Up a Virtual Environment Manually (General Steps):
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to your project folder.
- Run:

`python -m venv venv`

- Activate the environment:

`.\venv\Scripts\activate`
  

### 3. Install Dependencies

Before running the tests or the application, you need to install the required Python packages. Install the required
packages listed in the requirements.txt file using `pip`:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all necessary libraries such as Selenium, pytest, and any other dependencies specified.

---

## Running Tests
Make sure Python, pip, and Allure are installed and added to your PATH.

**Run Full Test Suite (Headless Mode)**

`pytest --headed=false --alluredir=reports`

OR also can be just run by

`pytest`

**Run Full Test Suite (Non-Headless With GUI)**

`pytest --headed=true --alluredir=reports`

**Run a Specific Test Case (Example: test_017)**

`pytest -s -k test_017_remove_products_from_cart.py`

**Generate & View Allure Report After Test Run**

`allure generate reports --clean -o allure-report`

`allure open allure-report`

**Run Tests in Specific Environments (Dynamic Environment Selection)**

This framework supports dynamic test environment selection via `--env` command-line flag. It uses environment-specific
base URLs configured in `config.py`. If no any env is selected then production will be taken as default.

`pytest --env=production`

For Staging- `--env=staging`

For QA- `--env=qa`

For Production- `--env=production`

**Clean Allure Report Data**

`if (Test-Path .\allure-results) { Remove-Item .\allure-results -Recurse -Force }`

`if (Test-Path .\allure-report)  { Remove-Item .\allure-report -Recurse -Force }`

`if (Test-Path .\allure-history) { Remove-Item .\allure-history -Recurse -Force }`
